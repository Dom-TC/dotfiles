# My Dotfiles

I've recently switched to managing my dotfiles with Chezmoi. This is still very much an experiment to see how I like it.

## To Do

- Consider asdf-direnv
- Move to XDG_BASE_DIR - See: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/XDG_Base_Directory
- Implement solution to set .chezmoi.toml data
  - Ask questions on run?
  - Environment variables?
